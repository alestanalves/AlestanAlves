### Hi, I'm Alestan 👋 ( ͡^ ͜ʖ ͡^)

I'm passionate about technology! I repair computers since I was 10 and I create software since I was 13 and it was at that age that I created a copy of an online game on a local server using Java, PHP and MySQL. I like challenges, books, developing new technologies using logic and analytical thinking.

I have knowledge in: Go, Python, Pandas, Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Java, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Keras, TensorFlow, Django, scikit-learn, servers, AWS, GCP, networks, cyber security, HTML, CSS, Git, Linux, MacOS, Windows and SCRUM.

Most of the time, I'm programming in Python, which is my favorite language and venturing into Go and Flutter in my free time, these two languages are the ones I have been enjoying.l at the moment. My passion is to have fun programming, playing the guitar, watching anime, reading books and articles every day. 

Let's have a coffee, I'm always open to learn new things and discuss crazy ideas. You can reach me at alestanalves@gmail.com

Try hard and admire the process!
